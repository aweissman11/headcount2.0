# HeadCount 2.0

HeadCount 2.0 was a project designed to challenge my skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components. There were a number of challenges with this project, chiefly finding ways to pass data down through React components efficiently, as well as ensuring that I have full testing coverage of all the components and methods in the program.

In order to take a look at this project, please take the following steps:

1. Clone down this repo
2. npm install
3. npm start

This will boot of a development server on your local system where you can view the project.
